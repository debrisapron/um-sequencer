# TODO

- Fix tests
- Fix example
- Special event type to easily automate tempo with appropriate curves.
- Handle changing sequence during playback.
  - If the sequence stays the same length, playback should continue seamlessly from the same point.
  - If the sequence changes length, playback position should "snap" to a configurable division (default to quarter-note).
- Play from specified time.
